Project 5 uses Python (and Anaconda) to analyze a dataset from Kaggle.com about movies. Additionally, we made some graphs, including a heat map and scatter plot.

The dataset used is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies. Data accessed on 11/15/22. Inspiration for this project comes from AlextheAnalyst.
