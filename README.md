# Project 1

Project 1 is an exploration of Monkeypox and COVID data using SQL.

The purpose of this project is to show some examples of SQL coding. GitHub only allows 25MB to be uploaded per file. My project here was 122MB. To fit my file, I had to delete all but a few queries. The deleted queries are in my Word Document along with comments.
