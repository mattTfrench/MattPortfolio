# Project 1

Project 1 is an exploration of Monkeypox and COVID data using SQL.

Unfortunately, my project in Microsoft Access was too big to upload here. Instead, I uploaded the 2 data sets and my SQL queries in a Word Document.

The purpose of this project is to show some examples of SQL coding. GitHub only allows 25MB to be uploaded per file. My project here was 122MB. The deleted queries are in my Word Document along with comments.
